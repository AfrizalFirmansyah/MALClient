# MALClient
It's rather robust MyAnimeList client application interfacing with both "official" api and the website api with wild endpoints with cookies and such. Right now it's available on Windows10 devices and android version is now in the works. It also supports Hummingbird with list managing.

### Compilation
You should be able to compile this thing out of the box, you may have to generate certificate though.
### Code
There are a few "dreadful places" but I think this code won't damage your eyes too much. (no promises!)
I'm planning big refactoring with developing for android.

If you are looking for methods to communicate with MAL go to Comm folder where you will find all queries.
